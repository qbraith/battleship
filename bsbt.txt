random text file for brainstorming battleship game

pieces: 1 len 5, 2 len 4, 3 len 3, 4 len 2
steps:
1. create 10x10 board

2. setup 
    randomly place all 10 cpu boards //COMPLETED


3. gameplay
    implement guessing mechanism to continue with game (shouldn't be too hard)
    check to see if there is a winner (all ships are sank), for both
    make board unable to place adjacent ships

errors to note:    
    skipping during playersetup is scuffed, fix ship numbers

    also try to fix the thing about ships being next to eachother around the edges

    make it so that it checks whether its close to a piece but also excludes index out of bounds errors

    consider having differnet colors to make it easier to see where computer guessed
    also maybe differnt colors for hits misses and ships on board

    refine for final product

compGuess method event loop:
    first turn:
        randomly choose spot on board as guess
        have algorithm to make sure computer can't pick same space twice (could be just numbers) (LinkedList)
        check whether spot on board is a hit or miss
        if its a miss:
            print that its a miss
            leave loop
        if its a hit:
            print that its a hit
            check whether ship has been sunk
                check if game is over
            given another turn:
                guess somewhere close to where they guessed previously (possibly poll or peek the linkedlist to get the first element)??
                    possible reverse insertion on the linkedlist THIS IS THE HARD PART 
                obtain guess that's close and check whether that is a hit or miss
                it should also be smart enough to guess another place close to where a hit was if a miss follows a hit
                    VERY HARD

                repeat loop until miss


current compGuess method:
    int row = r.nextInt(10);
        int col = r.nextInt(10);

        boolean guess = false;
        do {
            String result = (board[row][col].equals(".")) ? "MISS" : "HIT";
            if (result.equals("MISS")){
                guess = true;
            } else{
                //add logic to guess somewhere close if they got a hit
            }

            System.out.println("Computer gussed: " + letters[row] + col);
            System.out.print("Result...   ");
            Thread.sleep(750);
            System.out.println(result);

            guessed.add(String.valueOf(row) + String.valueOf(col));
        } while (!guess);
