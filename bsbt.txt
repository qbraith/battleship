random text file for brainstorming battleship game

pieces: 1 len 5, 2 len 4, 3 len 3, 4 len 2
steps:
1. create 10x10 board

2. setup 
    randomly place all 10 cpu boards //COMPLETED

    allow user to place all 10 of their boards 

3. gameplay
    implement guessing mechanism to continue with game (shouldn't be too hard)
    check to see if there is a winner (all ships are sank), for both

errors to note:    
    the computer spaceing algorithm doesn't work for pieces on the border

still to do:
    fix noted errors

    player can't place vertical ships on column 10, defaults to column 1
    
    finish compguess method with artificial intelligence (very hard)
    method will have to be boolean like playerguess

    create two variables in main method event loop for tracking whether game is over for each of the competitor guess methods
    while loop condition... so on

    possibly modify do/while loops in other methods to mimic start of compGuess do/while (more efficient)

    create some kind of method to print the two boards next to eachother, like how you see when you play real battleship

compGuess method event loop:
    first turn:
        randomly choose spot on board as guess
        have algorithm to make sure computer can't pick same space twice (could be just numbers) (LinkedList)
        check whether spot on board is a hit or miss
        if its a miss:
            print that its a miss
            leave loop
        if its a hit:
            print that its a hit
            check whether ship has been sunk
                check if game is over
            given another turn:
                guess somewhere close to where they guessed previously (possibly poll or peek the linkedlist to get the first element)??
                    possible reverse insertion on the linkedlist THIS IS THE HARD PART 
                obtain guess that's close and check whether that is a hit or miss
                it should also be smart enough to guess another place close to where a hit was if a miss follows a hit
                    VERY HARD

                repeat loop until miss


current compGuess method:
    int row = r.nextInt(10);
        int col = r.nextInt(10);

        boolean guess = false;
        do {
            String result = (board[row][col].equals(".")) ? "MISS" : "HIT";
            if (result.equals("MISS")){
                guess = true;
            } else{
                //add logic to guess somewhere close if they got a hit
            }

            System.out.println("Computer gussed: " + letters[row] + col);
            System.out.print("Result...   ");
            Thread.sleep(750);
            System.out.println(result);

            guessed.add(String.valueOf(row) + String.valueOf(col));
        } while (!guess);
